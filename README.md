## FAQ

### How to Use Env Config

- [Adding Custom Environment Variables](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-custom-environment-variables)

> Your project can consume variables declared in your environment as if they were declared locally in your JS files. By default you will have `NODE_ENV` defined for you, and any other environment variables starting with `REACT_APP_`. These environment variables will be defined for you on process.env. For example, having an environment variable named `REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE` will be exposed in your JS as `process.env.REACT_APP_SECRET_CODE`, in addition to `process.env.NODE_ENV`

- [Adding Development Environment Variables In `.env`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env)

> To define permanent environment variables, create a file called .env in the root of your project

### How to Use Multiple Env Configs

Right now it is possible installing [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and updating npm scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node -r dotenv/config ./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts start dotenv_config_path=development.env",
  "build": "node -r dotenv/config ./node_modules/.bin/react-scripts build dotenv_config_path=production.env"
}
```

There is the Pull Request [#1344](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1344) that implements [Support different env configs](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1343):

Read different `.env` configs according to current command (start / test / build).

What `.env*` files are used?

- `.env` - Default
- `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production` - Environment-specific settings.
- `.env.local` - Local overrides. This file is loaded for all environments except test.
- `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local` - Local overrides of environment-specific settings.

Files priority (file is skipped if does not exist):

- npm test - `.env.test.local`, `env.test`, `.env.local`, `.env`
- npm run build - `.env.production.local`, `env.production`, `.env.local`, `.env`
- npm start - `.env.development.local`, `env.development`, `.env.local`, `.env`

Priority from left to right.

By default (if custom config does not exist) read env variables from .env file.

### Advanced Configuration

<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/59e1be59d191ad29983a91b039f0e9089918dfb4/68747470733a2f2f7075752e73682f745866456c2f336361346536636264652e706e67" alt="Create React App Advanced Configuration"/>

These are environment variables. Use [cross-env](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cross-env) to set environment variables across platforms or _.env_ config.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "cross-env BROWSER=firefox react-scripts start"
}
```

If you use `.env` config - just add `BROWSER` variable:

```
BROWSER=none
```

### Lazy Loading

Original issue - [Lazy load (chunking) feature? #925](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/925)

> You can use require.ensure() because we use webpack under the hood.
> When we switch to webpack 2, you can use System.import instead.

### How to Setup Root Dir for Require

What is the alternative for `webpack module.resolveDirectory`?

Official solution: create `node_modules` at `src` directory - [src/node_modules as official solution for absolute imports #1065](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1065)

Another way - use `NODE_PATH` env variable. It is a directory name to be resolved to the current directory as well as its ancestors, and searched for modules. It is [resolve.modules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-modules) for webpack. More details at node official documentation ["Loading from the global folders"](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_loading_from_the_global_folders).

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "cross-env NODE_PATH=src/scripts react-scripts start"
}
```

If you use `.env` config - just add `NODE_PATH` variable:

```
NODE_PATH=src/scripts
```

## HMR (Hot Module Replacement)

By default HMR works only for CSS modules. If you want to use for components add these lines to _index.js_:

> NOTE: This will work but not preserve the components state, but redux / mobx / whatever state managers will be preserved

```js
// App - root component
import App from "./App";

const render = Root => {
  ReactDOM.render(<Root />, document.getElementById("root"));
};

render(App);

if (module.hot) {
  module.hot.accept("./App", () => {
    var NextApp = require("./App").default;
    render(NextApp);
  });
}
```

### How to Use Custom Babel Presets

Create React App [doesn’t support decorator syntax](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#can-i-use-decorators) at the moment.

There are PR [Adding support for custom babel configuration #1357](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1357). If PR is merged then these features will be available:

- [Decorators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-decorators)
- Features from [stage-0 preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-0/)
- Any new babel features and presets

PR is closed but

- As soon as feature becomes candidate - CRA will support it. Here is [tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/818626114037968899) about decorators.
- Features from stages 0 - 2 are not support because a lot of them hasn't been updated in a long time and doesn't appear to progress.

So we do not recommend to use babel presets besides the [babel-preset-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-react-app) that is already configured at Create React App.

### How to Change Webpack Entry Point and Output Dir?

There is the issue - [Customize build folder #1354](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1354).
This is feature is very useful along with entry point customizing and I have left [comment](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/1354#issuecomment-275647959) about this.

But according to this Pull Request [Fix- react-scripts build doesn't allow for specified path #1362](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/pull/1362#issuecomment-271284738) we should not expect such customizations in near future.

> won’t be introducing more configuration on a case-by-case basis. We might add support for a configuration file at some point, but not now.

There are some hacks how to change webpack config but note that it is officially unsupported and can break in any version.

### Watching Build Mode on Create React App

Example is [here](https://gist.github.com/int128/e0cdec598c5b3db728ff35758abdbafd)

### How to Change Webpack Config?

### How to Add Custom Webpack Plugins?

```json
"scripts": {
  "build:custom": "node scripts/webpack"
}
```

```js
// scripts/webpack.js
const webpack = require("react-scripts/node_modules/webpack");
const craWebpackConfig = require("react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod");
const OfflinePlugin = require("offline-plugin");

const config = {
  ...craWebpackConfig,
  plugins: [...craWebpackConfig.plugins, new OfflinePlugin()]
};

webpack(config).run(function(err, stats) {
  if (err !== null) {
    console.log("done");
  } else {
    console.log(err);
  }
});
```

**Note: this is officially unsupported and can break in any version.**

Also note that this is just webpack config extending, not `react-scripts build`. There is not beautiful console logs, comparison of the build size and other `react-scitpts build` command features.

Such approach (workaround) also helps to resolve problems when need to build/pubish a single component. There is the related issue - [How to publish components without ejecting #796](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/796). Just override webpack entry point and output.

Always remember that using not usual loaders (like yaml, markdown, dsv loaders etc.), additional plugins and features from drafts and proposals makes your application more complex, maybe with dead syntax features and it is become impossible to migrate from current webpack configuration.
