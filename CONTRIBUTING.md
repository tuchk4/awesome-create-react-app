# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. The only stipulation is that you ensure the added resource is _awesome_, and kind to everyone involved.

## Step-by-step

1. Fork, then clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:your-username/awesome-create-react-app.git`
2. Make your change
3. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
